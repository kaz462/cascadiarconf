  2019, 0,  100,
  2020, 0,  100,

## What's ADaM?

> ADaM defines dataset and metadata standards that support:
> efficient generation, replication, and review of clinical trial statistical analyses, and traceability among analysis results, analysis data, and data represented in the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM).
> ADaM is one of the required standards for data submission to FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan).

## Why Pharmaverse?

![](base_tidy_pharma.png){fig-align="center"}

## Does it work?

::: incremental
-   Pilot submission through R Consortium R Submission Working Group

-   Work closely with CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) working group

-   Advertising through conferences/social media/blog post
:::



::: {.notes}
- a cross industry pharma working group focusing on improving practices of R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.

- follow the latest standards

- 
:::
## How to take advantage of existing tools?

::: incremental
-   Actively evaluating what's available in the industry
-   Familiar with company-specific metadata/standards
-   Compare with internal SAS macro system
-   Bridge the gap between open-source R packages and the company's internal resources.

## Strategies

3 repos Study work with R: development/testing area, focusing `admiral` and its extension package

Leverage metadata/define.xml metacore metatools xportr Validation diffdf arsenal - Quarto website for knowledge sharing.

-   Internal R package: A toolbox that enables users from Bayer to program ADaM according to the Bayer-specific standard. It also includes a set of functions for the definx.xml process in R, allowing for smooth utilization of pharmaverse packages within the Bayer environment.

# Conclusion 

- R can be used as a powerful complement to traditional statistical programming languages, such as SAS. 
- Collaborate across the industry to tackle common problems
- Closer relationship between user and developers to deliver better products 
- Provide value to their organizations/industry.
