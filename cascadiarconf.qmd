1.  it's not always the case to have a clear specification, specs are clarified/updated through the programming process
2.  propose new layout/methods of displaying to improve efficiency

3.  clinical reporting with toolbox
4.  make new tools: see repetitions in work as opportunities to improve efficiency.

::: notes
p1. useful for "often-used" graphs but - lack of flexibility - learning curve, require good documentation, heavily reply on internal expert

P2. Creative Building Bricks-ggplot2(a complement to SAS graphs): intuitive and layered grammar of graphics approach - easier to create complex visualizations with relatively concise code. - high level of customization with a wide range of themes, color palettes, and options for tweaking graph elements.

SAS: While SAS offers powerful graphing capabilities, also allows customization, but the level of control might require more effort in some cases compared to ggplot2.

p3. lots of graph layout and ggplot2 extension packages

e.g., The R Graph Gallery/ `falcon`/`nest` TLG Catalog under pharmaverse

## What's CDISC/ADaM?

-   CDISC: Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium

-   ADaM standards outline how to create analysis datasets and associated metadata

![](cdiscstd.PNG){.fragment width="10.5in" height="3.4in"}

::: notes
-   CDISC is a global not-for-profit organization that actively develops data standards for pharmaceutical industry.

-   ADaM is one of the required standards for data submission to FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan).
:::

## Why Pharmaverse?

![](base_tidy_pharma.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
the amount of code needed for creating an ADaM dataset
:::

## Does it work?

-   Collaborate with CDISC to align with the latest standard
-   Pilot submissions to FDA through R Consortium's R Submission Working Group
-   Advertising through conferences, social media, and blog post

![](doesitwork.PNG){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
-   a cross industry pharma working group focusing on improving practices of R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions - to illustrate it works, and provide guidance on how it works
:::

## How to take advantage of existing tools?

::: incremental
-   Actively evaluate what's available in the industry

-   Become familiar with company-specific metadata/standards

    -   Compare them with internal SAS macro system

-   Bridge the gap between open-source R packages and the company's internal resources

::: notes
-   3 repos for people with different skills
-   Stay up-to-date with the latest R package issue status raised by Bayer users/Ensure users are informed about any ongoing issues and workaround

# Conclusion

-   R can serve as a powerful complement to SAS, particularly for data visualizations
-   Collaborate across the industry to tackle common problems
-   Growing user base and closer relationship between user & developers lead to the delivery of better products
-   Expanding talent pool benefits recruitment, fostering innovation, and driving continuous improvement.
