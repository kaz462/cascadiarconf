-   Imeplementation of TLF specifications
-   Communicate, propose new layout/methods of displaying to improve efficiency
:::

> 1.  Statistical Analysis: Collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop and execute statistical analysis plans. Apply advanced statistical methods to analyze complex data sets, interpret results, and generate actionable insights.
> 2.  Programming and Data Manipulation: Write efficient and well-documented code to manipulate, transform, and clean data. Develop and maintain data pipelines and scripts to ensure consistent and accurate data preparation for analysis.

# Initiatives in R

## Data Visulization

## What's ADaM?

> ADaM defines dataset and metadata standards that support:

> -   efficient generation, replication, and review of clinical trial statistical analyses, and
>
> -   traceability among analysis results, analysis data, and data represented in the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM).

> ADaM is one of the required standards for data submission to FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan).

## Why Pharmaverse?

## Does it work?
::: {.incremental}
- R Consortium R Submission Working Group: a cross industry pharma working group focusing on improving practices of R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.


- Work closely with CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) working group, to align with the latest standards

- Advertising through conferences/social media/blog post

:::

## How to take advantage of existing tools?
::: {.incremental}

- Actively evaluating what's available in the industry
- Familiar with company-specific metadata/standards 
- Compare with internal SAS macro system 
- Bridge the gap between open-source R packages and the company's internal resources.
